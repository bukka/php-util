====== PHP RFC: PHP Technical Committee ======
  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2023-03-03

  * Status: Draft

===== Introduction =====

PHP uses voting system for deciding about changes to PHP. This was created mainly for user visible changes in language.
It works well for that purpose but it is not that effective for deciding about purely technical changes that impact PHP
internals and extension API's. It is not exactly clear how it should resolve conflicts (on technical bases) between
contributors that sometimes happen.


===== Proposal =====

This RFC proposes introduction of the PHP Technical Committee (TC) that would decide about all technical aspects of
php-src. Specifically its main purpose is to decide about disagreements between contributors but it is not limited to
that only.

==== Definitions ====

The text contains various terms that need further clarification to prevent future wording dispute. Here are their
definitions:

  * contributor - Anyone who has already contributed to php-src.
  * core developer - Anyone with write commit right to php-src.
  * dev branch - php-src branch consisting of PHP- prefix and major and minor version number (e.g. PHP-8.2)
  * php-src - Source code in https://github.com/php/php-src/.
  * RM - PHP release managers.
  * technical aspect - Any issue or pull request in php-src or commit to php-src master and dev branches.
  * TC - PHP Technical Committee.
  * user facing feature - Feature resulting in change in PHP code (e.g. new language constructs, classes, functions and so on).

==== Work flow ====

The work flow for TC is following:

  - Any core developer can add label tc-hold on issue or pull request. 
  - The core developer should mention the TC GitHub team to notify members of the TC.
  - The TC discusses the issue or pull request and vote on it (this can be done privately)
    * The TC should consult with maintainers if the issue / PR changes or impacts code maintained by the maintainer
    * The TC should consult with RM if the issue / PR is about classification of the self contained feature or a bug
  - The TC announce its decision and reasoning by commenting on the issue or pull request
  - The core developer will follow the decision which can mean (not limited to):
    * merging the issue / PR
    * closing / rejecting the issue / PR  
    * making requested change to the PR

It should be noted that if the problem is with a specific commit, the core developer can create an issue specifying the
problem and put label on it.

==== TC Decisions ====

The TC members will only consider technical aspects. Specifically the decision is not made for user facing features
which continue to be decided by the RFC process. TC can however decide on the implementation of those features.

The TC can decide whether the issue / PR is a feature or a bug if there is a disagreement between RM and a core
developer. If it is a feature it can also decide if it is a self contained feature by assessing its technical
impact. This happens only on request like described in the work flow.

The way how to vote and discuss the issue is up to the TC members.

==== TC membership ====

The TC will be composed of 5 member who will be voted once a year together with release managers by the RFC process.
It will be done using a single transferable vote if more than 5 candiates volunteer. The candidate must be a core
developer and should have a general knowledge about PHP internals.

If one of the members wants or needs to drop out of being part of the TC, the new volunteer is selected using the RFC
process if there are more volunteer. The selection is automatic if there is only one volunteer.

===== Future Scope =====
This section details areas where the feature might be improved in future, but that are not currently proposed in this RFC.
